# phupload

> Post a photo to many places automatically

## Features

Upload/post/process your photos to the following places

- Cloudinary
- Custom script
- Flickr (in progress)
- Instagram (in progress)

## Usage

The usage is fairly simple, but requires some setup beforehand.

### Dependencies

`exiftool` is required on your system before this tool can work. It provides access to the EXIF data from your image to automatically know the title, description, camera make, camera model, etc. Installation will depend on your operating system, but you can view the [official installation instructions](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/install.html) for more info.

### Configuration

Add a `config.toml` file to `$HOME/.config/phupload/` to start configuration. This file is in the toml format, which is pretty basic (I think). I may entertain different file types later on!

Here's an example for all publishing types

```toml
[cloudinary]
cloud_name = "beardfury"
api_key = "123456789012345"
api_secret = "AbO1cdE2f3gHIjKLMOp4qrstUV5"

[[script]]
path = "/Users/mike/projects/portfolio/add_photo.sh"
```

### Running

To begin the upload process, pass the path to a photo file.

```sh
phupload ./my/photo.jpg
```
